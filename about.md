I am an applied mathematician with experience in computational modeling, numerical analysis, and technical communication.

After several years in academia, I am transitioning into industry roles where mathematical modeling, data analysis, and algorithmic thinking drive decision-making.

I am particularly interested in roles involving:

- Data science
- Quantitative modeling
- Scientific computing
- Simulation
- Technical problem solving
