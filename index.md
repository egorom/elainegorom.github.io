## Applied Mathematics for Real-World Systems

I am an applied mathematician and computational problem solver transitioning into industry.

My work focuses on:

- Numerical methods
- Nonlinear systems
- Modeling complex systems
- Algorithmic problem solving
- Scientific computing

I build models that turn messy real-world problems into structured, solvable systems.
