title: "Why Newton’s Method Still Matters"
---

Newton’s method is more than a classroom algorithm. It represents a powerful example of iterative refinement — a core principle in scientific computing and optimization.

In industry, the same idea appears in:

- Nonlinear solvers
- Machine learning optimization
- Parameter estimation
- Control systems

Understanding the structure behind convergence is more valuable than memorizing the update rule.
